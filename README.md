# My-Purchases (aka Purchase Hub)

### ***Purchase Hub*** is a full stack web application built with the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node) that allows users to ***create and manage digitized records of paper receipts***.  Upcoming updates will include customizable and auto set (already being developed) reminders to help you remember to return items before the return period is over.
